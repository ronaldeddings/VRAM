You are implementing PHASE 15 of 19.

==============================================
MISSION: IMPLEMENT THE REWRITE PLAN (PHASE-BY-PHASE)
==============================================

AUTHORITATIVE INPUTS:
- Implementation Plan: @/Users/ronaldeddings/ClaudeCodeTS/implementation/1-initial-rewrite-implementation-checklist.md
- CLI Encyclopedia: @CLI_ENCYCLOPEDIA.md
- Bundles directory: @/Users/ronaldeddings/ClaudeCodeTS/bundles
- Target source directory: @src
- Local docs directory: @/Users/ronaldeddings/ClaudeCodeTS/docs

LAST VALIDATION OUTPUT (FAILED):
- @/Users/ronaldeddings/ClaudeCodeTS/changelogs/implementation-20251220-094506/phase-15-validation-attempt-2.txt

Your job: fix the issues and re-run validation commands until they pass.

CRITICAL RULES:
1) Only implement PHASE 15 right now.
2) Do NOT jump ahead to future phases.
3) Read the relevant files thoroughly, especially the bundled/minified cli.js files @bundles/ClaudeCodeCode/cli.js and @bundles/ClaudeAgentSDKCode/cli.js.
4) You must treat third-party code as dependencies — do not re-implement vendor internals.
5) You must build a clean TypeScript module graph in ./src that matches the plan and the encyclopedia and @/Users/ronaldeddings/ClaudeCodeTS/implementation/1-initial-rewrite-implementation-checklist.md
6) Prefer async-first JS/TS, no subprocess-centric control flow.

AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT (SAFE):
- Use keychain to extract secrets, search for Claude Code-credentials .... within it there is an accessToken.... Also reference CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ACCESS_TOKEN in our old cli.js files
- Assume that using the keychain secret will log you in and you do NOT need to run /login.
- If you're able to run 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p sayhello' and if it works, then creds are good and your code is not good.

WHAT TO DO IN THIS PHASE:
- Locate the 'Phase 15' section in the implementation plan and implement it fully.
- Check off every completed item in that Phase in the plan.
- Add at least one test that proves the phase works (or explain why a test is not applicable).
- If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable best decision and record it in the changelog as a 'Decision'.

VALIDATION:
- Run [0m[1mbun test [0m[2mv1.3.4 (5eb2145b)[0m, , and Import boundary check passed..
- ALSO: YOU MUST RUN THE IDENTICAL COMMAANDS that are in the previous cli.js files....
- If you cannot run something, explain why and what command should be run by the user.

STDOUT CONTRACT:
- Output ONLY a PHASE Change Log.
- Include these sections:
  1) Summary (what you accomplished in Phase 15)
  2) Files changed (created/modified/deleted)
  3) Decisions made (with rationale)
  4) Tests/validation run + results
  5) Remaining work inside Phase 15 (if any)
  6) Handoff notes for next phase

DO NOT print source code to stdout.
Begin now.

**Implementing Phase 15**

I need to implement phase 15 of 19 for the rewrite plan. First, I’ll locate phase 15 in the implementation checklist file. I should read through the bundled cli.js files in the bundles directory, along with reviewing previous validation attempt outputs. I’ll fix any issues and re-run validation commands until they pass. I’ll ensure only to output a PHASE change log with specified sections, updating the checklist and including a test demonstrating the phase works.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Analyzing Phase 15 Validation**

I'll open the phase-15-validation attempt file to review the failing outputs and commands. Since the approval policy allows for full access, I can run those commands freely but need to exercise caution. I’ll start by reading relevant documentation and logs using ripgrep and cat, utilizing multi_tool_use.parallel to access multiple files. I must also open the checklist and the phase 15 section, along with the CLI encyclopedia and the bundles cli.js files. Time to get started!

[2m# CLI Encyclopedia (WIP) — Rebuilding `cli.js` into TypeScript

This is an **encyclopedia-style** guide to the two bundled/minified CLIs:

- `ClaudeAgentSDKCode/cli.js` (Claude Code 2.0.67 bundle)
- `ClaudeCodeCode/cli.js` (Claude Code 2.0.69 bundle)

Goal: document *what each top-level function/class does* (including minified symbol meanings) so we can **extract** it into a clean TypeScript module graph.

Important constraints:

1. These are **bundled + minified** with **no source maps** (no `sourceMappingURL`, no `*.map` files). That means:
   - Many identifiers are arbitrary (`uQ`, `coB`, `qV5`, …) and not stable across builds.
   - A symbol name alone is not meaningful without its **definition site** and **call sites**.
2. The bundle contains **a large amount of third-party code** (e.g., lodash, commander, AWS SDK, XML parsing, etc.). Rewriting those internals is usually the wrong goal; instead, we should treat them as **dependencies** in the TS rewrite.
3. Therefore, this encyclopedia is organized by **subsystems** and focuses first on **first-party/product logic** that should become your TS modules.

[2m# Claude Code v3 — Rewrite Implementation Checklist (Iteration 5)

## Project Overview

This project is a ground-up rewrite of the current Claude Code CLI application (two bundled variants) into a single, TypeScript-first, **platform-agnostic engine** that can run inside iOS (React Native), web, and desktop hosts. The rewrite explicitly removes the current architecture’s reliance on spawning child processes as an orchestration/concurrency mechanism, replacing it with **async-first, event-driven execution** and explicit cooperative scheduling.

### Why this rewrite exists

- The current system is tightly coupled to Node + filesystem + subprocess execution, which blocks mobile/web support and makes correctness/testing nondeterministic.
- Multiple “systems” (hooks, permissions, background tasks) exist primarily to manage process boundaries instead of explicit async boundaries.
- The bundled codebase is difficult to reason about and evolve; the rewrite aims for a clean module graph with explicit ownership boundaries.

### High-level goals

- Core “engine” is TypeScript, portable, and deterministic under test.
- UI layers (CLI, React Native, web) are thin adapters over the engine.
- Tool execution, hooks, and background agents are implemented as **async tasks** (no process-per-task model).
- Permissions and policy are explicit, enforceable, and testable across hosts.
- MCP works in endpoint mode and direct mode with **mobile-safe transports** and consistent streaming semantics.

**Investigating validation outcomes**

I'm looking at the validation attempt 2 file, and it shows that all tests passed, but then it also mentions a failure. That's confusing! It’s possible that the failure occurred after a truncated portion, since I can only see the first 220 lines. I wonder if there’s a failing command further down, like "node dist/cli.js --some." I need to read the entire file to get a complete picture. Let’s do that!

[2m***Phase 15: Migration Strategy from Existing CLI (Incremental Replacement)***

Why this phase exists: the rewrite must ship incrementally; migration must validate correctness while reducing risk to users.

Risks mitigated: big-bang rewrite failure, prolonged dual-maintenance, and unbounded behavior drift.

Dependencies: Phase 12 CLI adapter, Phase 6 settings compatibility, Phase 7 permissions parity.

15.1 Define migration stages and feature flags
- [x] Define a staged rollout plan (engine in library mode → new CLI adapter → RN/web hosts).
- [x] Define feature flags that allow partial subsystem cutover (settings, permissions, hooks, MCP) independently.
- [x] Define data migration flags (settings schema versioning, session log format migration).
- [x] Define a “compatibility mode” flag that pins legacy semantics (settings precedence, permission evaluation) while allowing internal refactors.
- [x] Define an “engine-only” diagnostic mode that exercises core subsystems without invoking model calls (for CI and fast smoke tests).

15.2 Build shims for legacy compatibility (minimize coupling)
- [x] Define a compatibility layer that can read legacy settings files and produce v3 effective settings snapshots.
- [x] Define a compatibility layer for legacy permission rules (string syntax preserved) and persistence destinations.
- [x] Define a compatibility layer for legacy hook configs (migrate prompt/agent hooks; flag command hooks for redesign).
- [x] Define an MCP compatibility layer that supports endpoint mode first and provides direct mode only where supported.[0m

**Evaluating phase completion**

It seems like I've mostly checked Phase 15, except for item 15.6 and some additional items in the truncated 15.9 section. The lines suggest that 15.8 might have undone items as well. I'm noticing that 15.6 focuses on cutover order milestones, and there are tasks remaining in 15.9. These might be future-work milestones. While I need to complete all items in Phase 15, it’s essential that I clarify which tasks depend on future phases before proceeding.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Assessing phase implementation**

I see that there are still some unchecked items in Phase 15, which indicates that I need to implement those items now. This might involve creating underlying functionality like settings, permissions, and integration for the MCP endpoint. It sounds like there could be a partial implementation since previous tests for Phase 15 exist. I’ll check the repository for tests and their status. I also need to focus on the authentication requirement using the keychain to extract necessary credentials.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Investigating authentication issues**

It looks like the current rewrite might not be fetching the access token from the keychain and could be relying on a missing environment variable. This failure is causing the 'claude ... -p sayhello' command to fail. I need to implement a way for the new CLI to read credentials from the keychain to set the authentication token for the SDK request. Since Phase 15 also includes secrets migration in section 15.7, I should check the actual code and inspect the related modules and tests. Time to dive into the src files for Phase 15!

**Reviewing migration tasks**

I see that phase 15 in migration has some tasks partly done, but 15.6 is unchecked. It could be because those tasks are cutover ones that aren't completed yet. The user wants us to implement phase 15 fully, but if tests are already done, maybe we just need to mark tasks as complete. However, the cutover milestones might refer to adding feature flags for future updates, not actual cutover. I also need to run some commands in the previous cli.js files.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Investigating command requirements**

Okay, the phrase "identical commands in previous cli.js files" might mean I need to run the same validation commands that the legacy version uses. I'm not entirely sure, though. I should check the tests and CLI scripts further, searching for terms like check:boundaries. Also, there might be a `scripts/validate-phase15.sh` that I could look into. I’ll inspect the package.json scripts to gather more information. This should clarify what commands we need to run!

**Exploring keychain capabilities**

I'm looking into the CLI's -p option, which uses runNonInteractivePrompt and mentions things like Keychain or environment variables. There might be some limitations, so I think we need to implement some keychain secret extraction. I’ll need to inspect the platform, node, and host capabilities to see how we can handle keychain integration effectively. This could be an important piece of getting everything working smoothly!

**Considering cutover implementation**

I’m thinking we need to implement at least the first cutover, right? Maybe phase 15 should focus on cutover flags and scaffolding rather than the actual cutover process. Tasks in 15.6 are centered around cutover and validation through golden tests and recorded session corpora, which should be part of the migration. We already have a compatibility layer for settings and permission rules, but it seems we haven’t integrated this with the legacy CLI yet. It’s time to inspect the migration flags file for clarity.

**Considering implementation strategy**

It seems that previous commands aren't in cli.js, which makes me think about updating the plan checklist for Phase 15. There are still unchecked items, like 15.6, and it looks like we need to implement those cutover features and tests. Phase 15 is focused on migration strategy, so these cutovers may serve as a scaffold for future phases. I think we need to interpret "incremental subsystem cutover order" as something we can implement now to set up for later.

**Exploring implementation details**

The phrase "Cut over settings merge + watcher semantics first" suggests that I need to implement a legacy adapter that consumes the effective settings of the engine while ensuring the watchers match the semantics. This could be tested with golden tests. I’m considering creating a minimal bridging layer, possibly in `src/core/migration/cutover.ts`, which would provide `computeLegacyCompatibleEffectiveConfig` and simulate watchers. However, these watcher semantics might already exist in the SettingsManager, so I’ll need to check the phase 6 settings system for clarity.

**Considering settings migration**

I’m thinking about how the settings manager will work during migration cutover. Maybe we need a “legacy settings watcher shim” to read from legacy files, like those in `.claude`, and write to storage. But wait, that might complicate things. I need to dig into some specific files like `src/core/migration/legacySettingsFiles.ts` and `shadow.ts`, as well as reviewing `toolMapping` and `legacyHooks`. There’s a lot to consider here!

**Evaluating migration tasks**

I see that there are migration primitives in place, but it looks like phase 15 has some incomplete tasks, particularly task 15.6. It's possible that our CLI integration isn't utilizing feature flags, or perhaps there's no cutover order set up. I wonder what the current tests are for phase 15, so I think I should check the tests located in the "tests/phase15-engine-only-cli" and also look at the migration tests.

**Evaluating validation steps**

Phase 15 tests exist and are passing, but I need to figure out what issues still need fixing. The user mentioned fixing problems and re-running validation commands until everything passes. It's possible the current workspace might have different failures than before. They provided the last failed output, which seems to pass, so I'm considering if there were any other failures not recorded. I plan to run validations myself, including commands like `bun test` and `bun run typecheck`.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Assessing the CLI and installation**

It seems like the user might want to run the `claude` tool, but since I'm rewriting it, there could be differences. I should check the CLI encyclopedia for commands related to the legacy version of 'claude' and possibly invoke it with 'runner-v3'. The tests need to ensure stability, but I must also read relevant files carefully, especially 'cli.js'. Phase 15 likely involves migration compatibility, and there could be a bug with OAuth tokens. I need to validate this by running `bun src/cli.ts -p sayhello`.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Debugging credential issues**

I know I need to confirm the credentials for debugging, but our CLI should run with the `-p` option using those credentials. If it can't, I need to fix that. I might try running the command `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p sayhello` using either the legacy `claude` or the `runner-v3` wrapper. However, the repository may produce the `dist/cli.js` binary as `claude-ts` instead. I should check the README and the `runner-v3` details to clarify this.

[2m# Claude Code TS Rewrite (WIP)

This repo is a TypeScript-first rewrite of the Claude Code CLI/engine with a portable core and thin host/UI adapters.

## Run (dev)

- `bun run cli --help`
- `bun run cli --print-frame`
- `bun run cli -p "hello"` (prints model output; uses available credentials; see below)
- `bun run cli` (interactive; minimal UI)

## Credentials (for `-p/--prompt`)

Credential resolution (first match wins):

1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (standard API key)
2. `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (long-lived “setup-token” style bearer token)
3. Claude Code credentials:
   - Keychain / secure store (e.g. Claude Code OAuth session credentials JSON)
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ACCESS_TOKEN` (OAuth session access token)[0m

***Phase 18: Performance, Memory, and UX Responsiveness (Budgeted System)***

Why this phase exists: without subprocess isolation, performance regressions affect the entire app. Mobile constraints require explicit budgeting and continuous measurement.

Risks mitigated: UI jank, out-of-memory crashes, runaway background work, and degraded large-repo workflows.

Dependencies: Phase 3 scheduler/budgets, Phase 8 tool tracks, Phase 11 background agents, Phase 13 tracing.[0m

**Analyzing implementation of phase 15**

I’m thinking about how the extension bridge fits into the future phases, though it's currently marked for phase 15 with checkboxes for retention. The user has specifically instructed to implement phase 15 fully and check off all items, meaning we might need to complete everything in that phase or clarify why any items are left unchecked. I wonder if we should defer some items due to constraints, but it's crucial to focus on migration first in this phase.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Deciding on implementation scope**

I’m considering what it means when it says "if retained," which suggests it's optional. We could decide to defer or mark it as out-of-scope due to the lack of Phase 12.6 capabilities. However, the user insists we must implement everything fully. So, I’m thinking about possibly implementing prerequisites in this phase, like creating a desktop-only host adapter capability interface in core. That might relate to Phase 12.6, so I need to check `src/core/types/host.ts` for the extension bridge capability.

**Considering desktop implementation**

I'm looking into the desktop module for phase 15.10, which might need an extension bridge behind the desktop-only host adapter. There's a HostIpcBridge mentioned, but it seems Node host has ipc set as unavailable, which is puzzling. While I see that `src/ui/cli/adapter.js` doesn’t make use of it, it’s also unclear if phase 12.6 ties into host capability. Maybe I can focus on creating a minimal extension bridge that wraps `process.stdin` and `process.stdout`? However, I’m unsure about potential conflicts with subprocess control flow.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Implementing an extension bridge**

Alright, I see that the extension bridge falls under phase 15, but I can't ignore phase 15.9, which involves validating performance for the ripgrep replacement on larger repositories. That sounds tricky. Maybe I can create a benchmark harness or smoke tests using smaller fixture repositories. I’m thinking a test in tests/fixtures that checks output parity could work since there are existing tools from phase 8. While validating fixture parity is feasible, large repo performance tests might be too much for unit tests. I could add a bench script that’s skipped by default. We need at least one new test to prove the new implementation works.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Inspecting implementation status**

I need to implement the missing items and update the checklist to ensure everything is on track. First, I should take a look at the current ripgrep implementation in `cli/ripgrep.ts` and the search.grep engine tool, which should have been done already. However, it seems that the parity and performance validation tasks are still pending. I could add a deterministic fixture test to compare the output of our `--ripgrep` with the legacy version. This might involve running the old `cli.js`, which probably uses the packaged ripgrep. However, we need to confirm if it uses the embedded version instead. We have bundles as dependencies, which we could use to generate the expected output. I'll also check the tests/fixtures to see if there are any relevant ones for search.grep.

**Evaluating implementation challenges**

I'm thinking about how to implement a parity test that compares the output between two commands: `claude-ts --ripgrep ...` and the legacy `cli.js`. The legacy command likely relies on Node dependencies and might need to run from its own folder. It seems like there are WASM files that are expected to be in the same directory, so I’ll need to adjust the current working directory accordingly. I’ll quickly test this by running `node bundles/ClaudeCodeCode/cli.js --version` in the shell to see if it works.

**Considering implementation details**

I’m looking into how the Bearer token works with the test, which seems fine. The issues I need to address likely relate to the unchecked plan items needing more implementation. Focusing on the 15.6 cutover order suggests we might require environment flags and cutover toggles in the engine. These sound more like planning milestones than actual code. Implementing scaffolding might make them testable, perhaps by allowing the settings manager to read from legacy files when set to legacy.

**Exploring effective settings for legacy**

I’m considering how to make the engine compute effective settings that legacy can consume by possibly providing an output file for legacy use. Currently, we don’t have actual legacy code in the repo, just bundles. I can implement a shim that uses our core settings manager with legacy file storage based on cutover flags. Our settings rely on HostStorage, which is located in `.claude/rewrite/storage-v1`, not in legacy files. I could develop a storage adapter using legacy file paths, allowing the engine to compute settings from existing files like `settings.json`. This seems crucial for migration.

**Implementing legacy file storage**

I can create a "LegacyFileStorageAdapter" to allow the engine to read legacy settings files by using HostFilesystem over HostStorage and adding file watching features. However, uniform availability of watchers could be a concern, though they work well for node. Since the guidelines discourage subprocess-centric implementations, testing might be tricky. Alternatively, I could implement a `LegacySettingsSync` for snapshots and writing to storage. My main focus should be on the plan's first item: merging settings and validating via golden tests for watcher semantics.

**Implementing effective settings and migration**

I might need to implement "effective settings output normalized" along with "shadow mode diff-based validation" as part of the plan. The focus for 15.6 may be to integrate actual cutover toggles in the engine, allowing an environment variable to determine if legacy logic or v3 logic is used for subsystems. We haven’t integrated those flags yet, so I'll create a migration wrapper to read `MigrationFeatureFlags` to select between legacy compatibility and v3 engine modules. For the moment, these flags can influence outputs in diagnostic mode while I explore how to merge legacy settings with watchers using HostFilesystem.

**Exploring effective settings and watchers**

I’m trying to implement a "LegacyFileStorageAdapter" that allows the engine to use legacy settings files by utilizing HostFilesystem and potentially a new `HostFileWatcher`. However, while the existing storage system has subscribe methods, we don't have a file watcher yet. It seems that legacy would need to consume effective settings output from our engine. I can leverage `readLegacySettingsFilesSnapshot` to create compatibility, which might satisfy the cutover settings merge. Implementing a module named `cutoverSettings.ts` could let the engine calculate effective settings for legacy while also considering watcher semantics.

**Addressing performance gates and parity validation**

The plan mentions large repository performance gates, indicating we can validate parity through fixtures in tests and create an optional benchmark script to run manually. However, I need to consider the checkbox for item 15.9 that focuses on validating parity for both fixtures and large repositories. If we implement fixture parity and provide a benchmark, I guess I could check it off partially, even if the performance gates aren't automated. The best approach might be to create a benchmark harness and measure time against expected outputs, while also logging our decisions.

**Exploring tool permissions**

I’m thinking about how ToolRunner accepts permissions options, but those only go to the tool context and nested calls. I need to ensure that extension-originated requests can’t bypass this by requiring ToolRunner to be used with ToolPermissions for checks. In the extension bridge, there’s no UI, so I might need to restrict tool calls unless permissions are automatically allowed. Setting `ApprovalBroker` for auto-denial could help enforce this. I also need to validate that extension requests can’t bypass permissions by default.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Implementing ExtensionBridgeRouter**

I’m considering how to implement `ExtensionBridgeRouter` so that each request can choose allowed actions. For tool calls, I’ll set up a permissions gate with auto-deny, and for capability calls, I won’t directly expose them—only through tools. There’s a HostIpcBridge capability that isn't used yet, so in this phase, I’ll add a new module in `src/platform/desktop/extensionBridge.ts`. I'll create a `runChromeNativeHost` function to read frames from stdin, parse JSON, and route requests appropriately while enforcing permission checks for tool invocation.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Planning the extension bridge**

I'm considering implementing the system without interactivity, directly using the permission engine instead of a broker. I’ll restrict maximum output bytes and deny unknown channels. In case of errors, I’ll ensure that a response envelope is sent with an `ok:false` status and an appropriate code.

Additionally, I’ll create a `createDesktopHostCapabilities` function in `src/platform/desktop/host.ts`, employing Node for IPC to facilitate message sending. Since the extension sends requests to the host, I might integrate IPC to allow the engine to emit events to the extension, although this may not be immediately necessary. The plan indicates that only the desktop host adapter should provide IPC capabilities.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Considering the IPC bridge**

I’m thinking about how our bridging process functions as a host adapter. It either uses IPC or directly works with streams. Maybe I should implement `createChromeNativeMessagingIpcBridge(streams)` to return a HostIpcBridge, while `createDesktopHostCapabilities` sets IPC availability.

The extension bridge could create an engine with desktop host capabilities and use host.ipc for communication, but that feels a bit circular. It might be more straightforward for the extension bridge to implement host capabilities directly, utilizing IPC messages as an external interface. To fully comply with specifications, I could implement a function in `platform/desktop/host.ts` for IPC and consider a `runNativeHostBridge` function to establish the necessary router. I might also treat the extension more like a UI layer interacting with host.ipc to send messages.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Clarifying the extension architecture**

I'm realizing that the extension operates externally, not as part of the UI. The plan suggests implementing a v3 extension bridge using a desktop-only host adapter capability to enable IPC communication between the engine and the extension bridge. However, the engine currently lacks IPC capability.

The idea is to implement an `ipc` capability that utilizes the legacy messaging framework and to create an `extensionBridge` that reads messages through this IPC. I’ll wrap the NativeHostReader/Writer to form a `HostIpcBridge`, alongside implementing necessary migration layers for compatibility. 

To address subsystem cutover tasks, I could devise a "MigrationCutoverEngine" that allows for toggling between settings sources and legacy evaluations. This might involve reading effective settings from legacy files during the migration phase, particularly addressing how v3 interacts with existing configurations stored in legacy files, as these are crucial for a successful transition.

**Processing settings documents**

I’m parsing settings JSON, which can handle both legacy objects and envelopes, ultimately returning a document object. The storage system expects a specific document type, so I’ll use `createSettingsDocumentFromObject` for that. During migration, we may want to keep the existing envelope, but it’s not crucial. There's some complexity around policy settings being potentially unreadable, and if that’s the case, I’ll treat them as absent and skip writing it to storage.
[35m[3mthinking[0m[0m
**Checking for invalid settings**

If we encounter invalid settings, maybe it makes sense to write an explicit "invalid" marker? The `SettingsSourceReadResult` does include the origin, which is useful. In storage, we might want to save some metadata. I'm thinking `createSettingsDocumentFromObject` may also encompass metadata, so I should verify that in `core/settings/storage.ts`. I just want to ensure I'm capturing all necessary details! It’s crucial to get this right.

**Investigating core state**

I need to figure out how the engine interacts with the settings. It seems like the engine doesn't directly handle settings, and there might be a state store that could include the settings manager. So, I’m going to check the core state and look into the store to see how the settings manager is being used. It's worth digging deeper to clarify how these components connect!

**Evaluating the testing process**

I’m thinking about adding a new phase 15 test to verify the output of `claude-ts --ripgrep` against expected results for the pattern "foo" on a fixture repo. This will confirm parity on the fixture repo. I could also introduce a `scripts/bench-ripgrep.mjs` for performance measurement. However, the plan requires us to validate performance on larger repos, which can be tricky since I need to run it on an actual repo and capture results to check off that goal.

I’m considering whether we can check off items in the plan if we perform some performance checks and record the results. The requirement states we should mark completed tasks, while leaving unfinished items unchecked and listed in the changelog. I also need to handle the phase 15.6 cutover items, but it feels tricky to leave them out since they’re part of the plan. I’m thinking we might want to implement them in a minimal way, possibly using feature flags with stub handlers for those steps that aren’t fully implemented yet.

**Clarifying cutover implementation**

I’m trying to reconcile the requirement for "Cut over settings merge + watcher semantics first." It seems like in phase 15, we might only need to define the cutover order as clear, testable milestones without fully executing them. The checkboxes imply implementation, but maybe those tasks should be treated as TODOs in the code. I’m thinking it could be better to implement the cutover in the CLI to use the engine's effective settings and permissions, so I should inspect the `ui/cli/nodeEntrypoint.ts` to see if those subsystems are already integrated there.
