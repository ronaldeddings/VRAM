# Deferred decisions (Phase 1)

These are explicitly *not* decided yet; later phases must create ADRs for them.

- Hook action surface and schema redesign (beyond legacy compatibility capture).
- Tool packaging + distribution across hosts (desktop vs mobile vs web).
- Isolation strategy (workers vs sandboxes vs host security boundaries).
- MCP transport choices for each host (SSE, WebSocket, fetch streaming, bridge).
- Final build/bundler toolchain for multi-host distribution.
