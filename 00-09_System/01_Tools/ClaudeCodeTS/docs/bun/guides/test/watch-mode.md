# Run tests in watch mode with Bun

Use the `--watch` flag to run your tests in watch mode.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test --watch
```

***

This will restart the running Bun process whenever a file change is detected. It's fast. In this example, the editor is configured to save the file on every keystroke.
