# Re-run tests multiple times with the Bun test runner

Use the `--rerun-each` flag to re-run every test multiple times with the Bun test runner. This is useful for finding flaky or non-deterministic tests.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
# re-run each test 10 times
bun test --rerun-each 10
```
