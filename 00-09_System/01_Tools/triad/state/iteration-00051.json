Key Observations\n\n### Meeting Volume & Infrastructure\n- **7,157 indexed meeting records** spanning June 2023 to January 2026\n- **Dual-format capture**: 2,424 markdown transcripts + 1,595 JSON metadata files\n- **Source**: Fathom.video AI meeting recorder\n- **Average meeting duration**: ~29 minutes (mode: 29-32 minutes)\n\n### Client Universe\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Unique client domains (all-time) | 300+ |\n| Clients with 20+ meetings | 50+ |\n| Discovery calls (2024) | 317 |\n| Discovery calls (2025) | 304 |\n| Discovery calls (2026 YTD) | 8 |\n\n### Top 10 Client Relationships (by meeting volume)\n| Client | Total Meetings | Relationship Span | Status |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------|\n| SANS.org | 952 | Dec 2023 → Dec 2025 | 🟡 ENGAGED |\n| CyberProof | 574 | Dec 2024 → Oct 2025 | 🟢 ACTIVE |\n| Picus Security | 306 | Jun 2024 → Oct 2025 | 🟡 ENGAGED |\n| Interpres Security | 227 | Oct 2023 → Feb 2025 | 🔴 DORMANT |\n| Nagomi Security | 186 | Jun 2024 → Nov 2025 | 🟢 ACTIVE |\n| Aka Identity | 139 | Jan 2024 → Oct 2025 | 🟡 ENGAGED |\n| 7AI | 100 | Apr 2025 → Nov 2025 | 🟢 ACTIVE |\n| Orchid Security | 98 | Oct 2024 → Dec 2025 | 🟡 ENGAGED |\n| NetSPI | 94 | Oct 2023 → Apr 2025 | 🔴 DORMANT |\n| WriteAlchemist | 93 | Oct 2023 → May 2025 | 🔴 DORMANT |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Insights\n\n### Relationship Health Distribution\n- **🟢 Active (high engagement)**: CyberProof, Nagomi, 7AI, VIA Science\n- **🟡 Engaged (moderate)**: SANS, Picus, Orchid, Tines\n- **🔴 Dormant (at-risk)**: Interpres (171 meetings!), NetSPI (49), Uno.ai (83), WriteAlchemist (93)\n\n### Critical Finding: At-Risk High-Value Relationships\n**Interpres Security** - 171 total meetings, last contact Feb 2025 - represents one of HVM's deepest relationships that has gone completely dark for 11+ months.\n\n**Other high-value dormant relationships**:\n- WriteAlchemist: 93 meetings, silent since May 2025\n- Uno.ai: 83 meetings, silent since Jan 2025\n- NetSPI: 49 meetings, silent since Apr 2025\n- Belay Solutions: 32 meetings, silent since Jun 2024\n\n### Service Mix Patterns\n- **SANS**: DMA programs, bi-weekly syncs, event coverage\n- **CyberProof**: Livestreams, weekly meetings, service videos\n- **Nagomi**: Docuseries production (\"The Worst Job I Ever Wanted\")\n- **7AI**: Weekly podcast production calls\n- **Orchid**: Strategy sessions, regular syncs\n\n### Team Allocation Insights\n- **Emily Humphrey**: Primary relationship owner for SANS (404 meetings), CyberProof (248)\n- **Klancy Baker**: Cross-client coverage (CyberProof, Nagomi)\n- **Danielle Lewan**: Nagomi specialist (232 meetings)\n- **Chris Cochran**: SANS relationship (136 meetings)\n\n### Client Retention Reality\n- **2024→2025 retention**: 18.7% (40 of 213 client domains retained)\n- However, this is misleading - many \"churned\" clients were one-time discovery calls\n- **True at-risk**: 20 clients with >20 meetings and no recent activity\n\n---\n\n## 3. Opportunities\n\n### Immediate Win-Back Campaigns (High-Value Dormant Clients)\n1. **Interpres Security** (171 meetings, 11 months dormant)\n   - Last known activity: Feb 2025\n   - Represents potentially the largest relationship recovery opportunity\n   \n2. **WriteAlchemist** (93 meetings, 8 months dormant)\n   - Known point of contact; warm relationship possible\n\n3. **Uno.ai** (83 meetings, 12 months dormant)\n   - Company Story Video engagement visible in titles\n\n4. **NetSPI** (49 meetings, 9 months dormant)\n   - Strategy sync history suggests expansion potential\n\n### Upsell Intelligence Extraction\nThe transcripts contain **embedded business intelligence** that could reveal:\n- Pricing discussions across clients\n- Budget cycles and fiscal year patterns\n- Service satisfaction signals\n- Competitive mentions (349 transcripts reference competitors)\n- Expansion opportunities (\"additional,\" \"phase 2,\" \"next project\" mentions)\n\n### Automated Relationship Monitoring\nBuild an alert system that flags:\n- Clients with 5+ meeting history going 30+ days without contact\n- Declining meeting frequency patterns\n- Sentiment shifts in transcripts\n\n---\n\n## 4. Connections\n\n### Integration with Previous Insights\n- **Financial Intelligence** (Iter 50): Meeting transcripts contain budget discussions that could feed revenue forecasting models\n- **Provider Role Pattern**: The high meeting volume (~3,000/year) reflects Ron's role as service provider and relationship holder\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Many meetings are internal syncs (Emily sync: 136, Team DSU: 76) - potential process optimization opportunity\n\n### Cross-Life-Area Links\n- **Work → Finance**: Client engagement data should correlate with QuickBooks revenue data\n- **Work → System**: Meeting data could enhance the Triad analysis with real-time relationship health dashboards\n\n### Content Production Pipeline\nMeeting titles reveal the production pipeline:\n- Discovery → Strategy → Kickoff → Weekly Sync → Review\n- Content types: Podcasts, Livestreams, Docuseries, Service Videos, Event Coverage\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (This Week)\n1. **Interpres Outreach**: Research what happened to this relationship - 171 meetings to zero in one month is a significant signal\n2. **At-Risk Dashboard**: Create a simple query that runs weekly showing clients with >20 meetings going dormant\n3. **SANS Relationship Check**: 952 meetings but declining engagement (26→2 monthly meetings) - needs attention\n\n### Short-Term (30 Days)\n1. **Client Health Scoring System**: Implement the following metrics per client:\n   - Meeting recency (days since last contact)\n   - Meeting frequency trend (3-month rolling average)\n   - Team allocation (primary contact identified)\n   - Service engagement breadth (podcast, video, events)\n\n2. **Win-Back Campaign**: Prioritize outreach to:\n   - Interpres (highest value)\n   - WriteAlchemist\n   - Uno.ai\n   - NetSPI\n\n3. **Pipeline Health Report**: Track discovery-to-engagement conversion monthly\n\n### Long-Term (90 Days)\n1. **CRM Integration**: Export client relationship scores to NocoDB (mentioned in transcripts as migration target)\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Build NLP pipeline to extract satisfaction signals from transcripts\n3. **Competitive Intelligence**: Parse the 349 competitor mentions to understand market positioning\n4. **Revenue Attribution**: Connect meeting engagement with financial performance data\n\n---\n\n## Data Quality Notes\n- **Format inconsistency**: 881 meetings have both .md and .json, but 1,543 are .md-only and 714 are .json-only\n- **Participant tracking**: Many client participant emails are empty, limiting company attribution\n- **Some transcripts contain Fathom artifacts** (\"Thank you\" repeated filler when audio unclear)",

      "output": "**Key Observations**\n- 10,293 files in `10-19_Work/13_Meetings`, split across `10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts` (2,424 `.md` + 1,595 `.json`), `10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.02_recordings` (3,136 `.mp4`), and `10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.03_metadata` (3,138 `.json`).\n- All 2,424 transcript IDs have metadata; 714 metadata entries lack transcripts; 2 metadata entries lack recordings.\n- Cadence: 2024 has 1,187 transcripts, 2025 has 934, 2026‑to‑date has 32; peaks at 2024‑07 (133) and 2025‑10 (122), with a late‑2025 dip.\n- Meeting duration median is 31 minutes (p25 21, p75 51) and participant median is 5 (p25 4, p75 6); max duration 949 minutes suggests a left‑running recording.\n- Titles are often generic (316 “Zoom Meeting”, 143 “Impromptu Zoom Meeting”) and heavily “sync/weekly” (1,304 sync; 361 weekly); discovery (138) and onboarding (56) exist, but proposal/contract/renewal appear rarely.\n- Partner signals appear mostly in titles using “<>” (476 titles, ~15.2%); frequent partners include Interpres, CyberProof, SANS, Orchid, 7AI, Picus, Tines, Nagomi, NetSPI, Deepwatch, Brightside AI.\n\n**Insights**\n- Metadata `participants.company` is effectively empty (only “Hacker Valley Media”), so client identity must be inferred from titles and transcript content.\n- The title taxonomy shows mature, recurring relationships (sync/weekly) but weak explicit lifecycle labeling (proposal/contract/renewal), which hides pipeline stage visibility.\n- Transcript keyword density is strong for operational/commercial terms (budget, scope, deliverable, contract, follow‑up), so relationship intelligence is available but unstructured.\n- Generic titles materially reduce searchability and client recall; simple naming discipline would unlock immediate intelligence gains without new tooling.\n- Dormant partner signals are visible via title‑based recency (e.g., Interpres last 2024‑12‑17; BQ 2024‑01‑05; Uno 2024‑06‑14; ThreatLocker 2024‑03‑20).\n\n**Opportunities**\n- Build a lightweight client relationship index from title patterns + transcript cues (partner name, meeting type, last contact date, action items).\n- Launch re‑engagement for dormant partners identified above; prioritize those with prior high cadence.\n- Standardize meeting titles to include partner + stage (e.g., “Client <> HVM | Discovery”) to improve future analytics.\n- Auto‑extract action items/next steps into a follow‑up queue; these phrases appear in 226 and 377 transcripts respectively.\n- Flag anomalous recordings (very long duration or high participant count) for cleanup or special handling.\n\n**Connections**\n- Finance: repeated budget/pricing/payment/invoice language aligns with `20-29_Finance` planning and revenue tracking.\n- Growth: discovery/strategy/onboarding in titles aligns with `60-69_Growth` and content partnerships (SANS/RSA/ISSA mentions).\n- Operations: “sync/weekly/DSU” cadence mirrors internal rhythms, suggesting a chance to align client updates with internal DSUs.\n- Business development: partner set overlaps known industry ecosystems; relationship intelligence can feed the bizdev pipeline.\n- Triad roadmap: directly supports client‑profile and relationship‑health items in `00-09_System/01_Tools/triad/docs/plans/implementation-plan-v3.md`.\n\n**Recommendations**\n- Implement a partner extraction pass prioritizing “<>” titles plus HV/HVM patterns, then enrich with transcript keywords (budget/scope/deliverables) to infer stage.\n- Build a “last‑contact + cadence” dashboard per partner and a dormant list for outreach; start with Interpres, CyberProof, SANS, Orchid, 7AI, Picus.\n- Establish a naming template for new meetings and backfill recent high‑value partner titles (last 3–6 months).\n- Add a transcript‑driven follow‑up rollup (action items + next steps + owner) to reduce lost tasks.\n- Triad improvement: `files_fts` in `00-09_System/00_Index/search.db` throws `fts5: missing row ...` on full‑text queries; rebuild/repair the FTS index.\n- Triad improvement: consolidate duplicate metadata sources (`13.01_transcripts` `.json` vs `13.03_metadata`) and document a canonical source to prevent drift.\n\nIf you want, I can extract a concrete dormant‑partner list with last‑meeting dates and meeting counts, or draft a title‑naming convention doc to roll out.",
