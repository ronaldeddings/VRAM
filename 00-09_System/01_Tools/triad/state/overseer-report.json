    "The transcript corpus is the operational backbone: thousands of meetings, heavy coordination load, and broad topic coverage (strategy, ops, hiring, tooling).",
    "“Work” contains substantial personal/health/family signals; Personal/Family areas are almost empty, so work meetings are functioning as the universal inbox.",
    "There’s a consistent “follow‑up gap”: decisions/risk are discussed often, but explicit action capture is sparse.",
    "Tooling friction (Notion vs Airtable, Premiere complaints) shows up as a recurring theme, suggesting process drag.",
    "The index is the lens for most analysis, but it has integrity issues (FTS/content mismatch) and limited file‑type coverage.",
    "Work ↔ Personal: personal themes exist inside work meetings rather than in their intended areas; this explains the “empty Personal/Family” artifacts.",
    "System ↔ Work: ingestion spikes and FTS drift indicate tooling/indexing decisions shape what is visible and trustworthy.",
    "Meetings ↔ Ops friction: high meeting volume + schedule‑slip language implies operational overload and context switching costs.",
    "Content ↔ Tools: transcripts themselves contain requirements/specs for tooling changes (e.g., Airtable migration).",
    ". Build a decision/action extraction layer from transcripts. High impact, directly addresses the “follow‑up gap.”"
