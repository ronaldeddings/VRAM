    "Agent 1: Not compliant; only states intent, no evidence, no analysis.",
    "Agent 2: Strong, evidence‑anchored, actionable; best coverage of Finance focus; flags specific files and risks.",
    "Agent 3: Not compliant; mostly intent, includes speculative “ignore pattern restrictions” with no proof.",
    "Agent 4: Off‑scope (Career & Skills, Iteration 74) and mixes unverified claims; useful conceptual framing but not aligned to current Finance focus.",
    "Agent 5: Strong, evidence‑anchored; corrects/qualifies claims; adds nuanced operational findings; aligns to HVM focus.",
    "Core reality: HVM runs a sophisticated revenue engine (pricing discipline, margin targets, structured invoicing) but has **no centralized Finance system of record** in `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance`. This gap is systemic, not just organizational.",
    "Financial truth lives in **communications and transcripts** (email threads, meeting recaps, Slack), not in the Finance domain. This is consistent across Agents 2 and 5 and explains the “phantom finance” perception.",
    "External due‑diligence pressure exists (CRA requested financial statements and budget), yet QuickBooks cleanup is noted as a blocker, signaling **audit‑readiness risk**.",
    "Operational payment rails are fragmented (Zelle/ACH/wire/Justworks), raising reconciliation and compliance friction.",
    "Contracts/SOWs and billing artifacts are scattered, creating **legal and cash‑collection risk** despite strong operational cadence."
