Pulled evidence from `search.db` plus a few recent Hacker Valley Media meeting summaries/emails to ground the analysis.

**Key Observations**
- The Hacker Valley Media area is a “skeleton folder”: `10-19_Work/10_Hacker_Valley_Media` has only empty subfolders and a `.DS_Store`, no working content.
- “Hacker Valley” lives almost entirely in Communications/Meetings, not the HVM folder: 53,951 hits in Work/Communications and 6,290 in Work/Meetings via `content LIKE '%Hacker Valley%'`.
- “Hacker Valley Media” is referenced heavily (36,803 hits via `content LIKE '%Hacker Valley Media%'`), which implies active operations but scattered storage.
- Recent meeting summaries show a consistent service package: livestream → edited episode → short clips, $10k/month for 30 credits (eSentire), and a “Gold Package” with lead gen + full content rights (McIntyre).
- The 2021 media kit thread captures brand proof (awards, top episodes, 20k monthly listens), but it likely needs updates.

**Insights**
- There is a clear “empty bucket, full pipeline” paradox: the business is active, but its knowledge base is trapped in comms rather than a central HVM repository.
- Pricing, audience mix, and delivery model are consistent across time, but not consolidated—creating avoidable rework and increased follow‑up friction.
- Partnership data (budgets, competitors, positioning) is present in meeting summaries but not converted into reusable sales artifacts.

**Opportunities**
- Build a single HVM source of truth (offerings, audience stats, case studies, assets, process docs) to reduce re‑extraction from comms.
- Convert meeting summaries into a lightweight pipeline tracker to prevent deal loss and repeat intros.
- Update/normalize the media kit with current metrics, customer examples, and a “package selector” page.

**Connections**
- Finance: package pricing ($10k/mo, $12k/quarter benchmarks) and sponsorship models connect to `20-29_Finance` planning.
- Growth/Marketing: audience stats, lead-gen numbers, and awards directly fuel sponsorship and sales collateral.
- Operations: the livestream‑to‑podcast‑to‑clip workflow is a strong SOP candidate for `10.05_operations`.
- System/Tools: heavy dependence on Slack + Fathom indicates automations could harvest insights into structured docs.

**Recommendations**
- Create a “HVM HQ” set of docs under `10-19_Work/10_Hacker_Valley_Media`:
  - `10.03_marketing/Media_Kit.md` with version/date, latest metrics, awards, top episodes.
  - `10.04_partnerships/Offerings.md` (packages, pricing, deliverables, lead‑gen stats).
  - `10.05_operations/Production_SOP.md` (livestream → episode → clips).
- Establish a simple pipeline tracker (spreadsheet or CRM) and weekly review cadence:
  - fields: lead, source, package, next step, last touch, follow‑up date.
- Extract action items from key summaries (e.g., eSentire, McIntyre) into the tracker and schedule follow‑ups.
- Archive a “competitive/market notes” doc (e.g., Cybersecurity Ventures benchmark) for sales positioning.

**Triad Improvement Noted**
- `search.db` FTS index appears inconsistent (`fts5: missing row ... from content table 'files'`). Consider adding a periodic FTS integrity check/rebuild step in Triad’s indexing pipeline to avoid query errors or missing results.

If you want, I can draft a lightweight HVM folder structure and a starter media kit outline (read‑only suggestions only).
