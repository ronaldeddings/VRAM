AGENTS.md not found under `/Volumes/VRAM`; proceeding with default instructions.

**Key Observations**
- The `40-49_Family` area is scaffolded but empty (only folders and `.DS_Store`), so no family memories/events/documents are being captured in the intended place.
- Family events appear in work meeting transcripts rather than the family system (e.g., Orlando trip in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-06-522244293.md:33`, daughter’s graduation party in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-519876848.md:879`).
- Family priority and provider identity are explicitly stated in work contexts (“more time for my family” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-07-523682405.md:55`; “provide for my family” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-06-522244293.md:461`).
- Daily reflections track `family_time_done`, but the pattern skews false (e.g., true in `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection/30.01_daily/2025-10-13.md:11` vs false in `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection/30.01_daily/2025-10-19.md:12`).
- Weekly reflection emphasizes pruning draining relationships, signaling active boundary work (see `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection/30.02_weekly/2025-W42.md:10`).
- A work recap explicitly warns about work-driven family strain and missed milestones (see `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-04-15_211018_015880_Recap of your meeting with Hacker Valley Media.md:28`).

**Insights**
- There’s a clear capture gap: family is important and discussed, but the family system isn’t recording it, increasing the risk of memory loss and misalignment with stated priorities.
- Work is the dominant capture surface for family narratives, which can unintentionally frame family through a work lens.
- Relationship pruning is active, but family relationship cultivation lacks a dedicated, low-friction workflow.

**Opportunities**
- Start a minimal family capture loop: a lightweight event log and memory highlights to prevent loss of key moments.
- Use the existing daily reflection `family_time_done` field as a trigger to create or update a family entry.
- Backfill two recent family events from work transcripts to establish momentum (Orlando trip, graduation party).
- Define a yearly traditions note (e.g., the Orlando trip) to turn recurring events into anchor rituals.

**Connections**
- Work meetings and communications already contain family context, which can be linked back into the family system.
- The personal reflection system already tracks family time, offering a built-in signal for capture.
- Professional relationship systems are being formalized, while the family area remains empty—suggesting an imbalance between external and internal relationship tracking.

**Recommendations**
- Create a simple `Family Event Log` template in `/Volumes/VRAM/40-49_Family/41_Events` with fields: date, people, 3-sentence summary, photo link, “next time do/avoid”.
- Backfill two entries from work transcripts: Orlando annual trip (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-06-522244293.md:33`) and daughter’s graduation party (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-519876848.md:879`).
- Add a weekly 15‑minute “family capture” review that scans the week’s notes/transcripts for family mentions and logs them.
- When `family_time_done` is true, add one sentence to the daily note and link it to the event log entry (keeps capture lightweight but consistent).

**Triad Improvements**
- Add a “family mention detector” pass that flags meeting transcripts with family keywords and prompts a capture task into `/Volumes/VRAM/40-49_Family/41_Events`.
- Add a “Family Area Empty” warning in the Relationships & Family analysis if `40-49_Family` contains no user-created files.
