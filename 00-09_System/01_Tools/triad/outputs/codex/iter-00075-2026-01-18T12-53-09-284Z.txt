I have all 8 items added to my internal todo list and will execute each one thoroughly.

AGENTS.md check: I only found AGENTS.md inside Recharts node_modules (e.g., `/Volumes/VRAM/00-09_System/01_Tools/Maestro/node_modules/recharts/AGENTS.md`), which are not applicable to VRAM analysis. No additional AGENTS instructions apply to `/Volumes/VRAM`.

**VALIDATION OF GEMINI-ALPHA FINDINGS**
- The “empty treasury” hypothesis is accurate and now fully verified with filesystem evidence: the finance area is scaffolded but contains no real financial artifacts. `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` and its subfolders (`/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/20_Banking`, `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/21_Investments`, `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/22_Taxes`, `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/23_Insurance`, `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/24_Real_Estate`, `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/25_Archive`) contain only `.gitkeep` and `.DS_Store` files. The structure itself is recent (created January 12, 2026, modified January 17, 2026), which suggests a new organizational attempt that has not yet been populated.  
- The “shadow data in communications/meetings” claim is directionally correct and now validated with specific evidence. Financial operations are captured in emails and meeting transcripts rather than in `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance`. Examples include invoicing and collections in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-05-20_155343_013298_RE [EXTERNAL] Re Entrust RSA Package, Invoice #384.md`, budget decisions in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-08_163329_026105_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`, and QuickBooks/HubSpot billing integration in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`.  
- Gemini‑Alpha’s mention of Suzu Labs and McIntyre transcripts is not directly financial and not essential to the current Financial focus. Those transcripts exist, but they do not materially change the core financial picture already evidenced by the documents above.  
- The “regex search failed / ignore pattern restrictions” claim cannot be validated. I was able to access files directly with shell and SQLite queries without any special bypass.  

**NEW DISCOVERIES**
- A formal financial due‑diligence request already exists from Cyber Risk Alliance (CRA), and it explicitly asks for core financial statements and a budget. On March 19, 2024, CRA requested “Detailed comparative Income Statement, Balance Sheet (and Statement of Cash Flows, if available) for the past two calendar years and the 2024 budget,” plus product‑level revenue and margins in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-03-19_212900_039897_RE Hacker Valley & CRA Meeting Agenda.md`. This is a clear signal that external partners expect professionalized financial reporting.  
- QuickBooks hygiene is a blocking dependency for CRA requirements. On January 9, 2025, the Emily sync recap notes “QuickBooks cleanup is necessary before proceeding with CRA requirements” and that HubSpot→QuickBooks invoice syncing is configured in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`. This suggests the operational accounting system exists but is not audit‑ready.  
- There is a detailed invoice ledger of $4,000 keynote invoices with due dates and payment methods, showing a real accounts receivable workflow. The January 13, 2025 email lists multiple invoices (INV‑3800 through INV‑3809) paid “via ACH,” with two outstanding invoices (INV‑3811 Charles Schwab and INV‑3812 Asana) still unresolved as of January 12, 2025 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-13_110833_022627_Re Keynote Invoices Charles Schwab & Asana.md`. This is evidence of structured billing plus open AR risk.  
- Vendor onboarding and collections friction is visible in the Entrust invoice thread, including W‑9 updates and overdue invoice follow‑up. The May 20, 2025 thread in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-05-20_155343_013298_RE [EXTERNAL] Re Entrust RSA Package, Invoice #384.md` includes a note that the invoice was overdue as of May 2, 2025 and that Entrust required a new W‑9 because the prior form was outdated (“Your W‑9 is a very old version”). This is a concrete collections and vendor‑setup risk.  
- Contractor payments are inconsistent and operationally painful. The November 25, 2024 Fathom recap (“Zoom Meeting”) explicitly states “Zelle setup for Emily was successful, but encountered issues when trying to send payments,” and that bank transfers and Justworks were used as alternatives in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-25_192205_025174_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`. This is a direct signal of payment‑process fragility.  
- There is evidence of multiple payment rails used simultaneously: Zelle, ACH, wire, and Justworks. Examples include Zelle payment confirmation for $2,537.37 on November 25, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-25_131910_025121_Zelle® payment of $2,537.37 to Claudio Zelaya has.md`; a $500 Zelle payment on January 14, 2025 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-14_181030_022683_Zelle® payment of $500.00 to CHURCH UNSCRIPTED has.md`; ACH deposit notification from SANS on November 22, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-22_131621_025364_Re ACH Notification.md`; and wire confirmation to “SPANISH FIXERS, SLU” on November 26, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-26_081118_025124_We've sent your wire.md`. This diversity increases reconciliation complexity and fraud risk.  
- Justworks is being used not only for payroll/benefits but also for vendor payments. On January 22, 2025, a $155 payment categorized as “Rent or machine rentals” to Might Cloud LLC was scheduled in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-22_150355_022254_1 payment has been scheduled on Justworks.md`. This is evidence of an operational AP channel, but it is not centralized in the Finance area.  
- Project budgets and contract values are large and show significant revenue potential; these decisions are recorded in meeting recaps rather than a financial system of record. Examples include a $75K Nagomi docu‑series contract with non‑refundable payment terms in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-16_213458_027367_Recap for SANS Proposal Build & Nagomi.md`, a $9K budget‑constrained event coverage plan in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-28_193110_026946_Recap for CyberMarketingCon & Orchid sync.md`, and an international production budget that must be reduced from ~$70K to $50K in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-08_163329_026105_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`.  
- Pricing strategy is explicitly defined in internal transcripts, including a non‑sold $6,200 entry package and margin targets. In the January 2, 2026 transcript, Ron says the silver package is “$6,200” and “I will never sell this package” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-519876848.md`. In a separate January 2, 2026 transcript, he states “I have this budget calculator” and targets margins “at least double… at least triple” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-521053578.md`. This shows pricing discipline but no corresponding documentation in Finance.  
- Invoicing responsibility is delegated internally, yet the invoice artifacts still live outside the Finance folder. In `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-521053578.md`, Ron says “Ivan is handling invoicing,” with the expectation that collections continue smoothly. This confirms operational delegation without file‑system consolidation.  
- Contracts and SOWs are actively coordinated in Slack, reinforcing the “documents in comms” pattern. A Slack message on July 5, 2023 asks “Do you have the new CS SOW handy?” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.02_slack/json/D93FQQ52P/2023-07-05.json`. This shows that contract artifacts are being shared in transient channels rather than stored centrally.  
- Benefits and retirement planning appear in vendor emails but have no corresponding archival home. For example, a Justworks 401(k) plan follow‑up from April 13, 2023 is in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2023/2023-04-13_145320_056855_RE Justworks 401(k) Plan - Hacker Valley Media.md`, and HSA/FSA availability is announced on December 6, 2023 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2023/2023-12-06_163642_046557_Start offering HSAs and FSAs for 2024.md`. These are benefits‑level financial items that should reside in `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/23_Insurance` or a related HR/benefits subfolder.  

**SYNTHESIS**
The financial picture that emerges is paradoxical: Hacker Valley operates with sophisticated revenue mechanics and pricing discipline, yet the financial artifacts and controls that normally support a business of this complexity are scattered across emails, meeting recaps, and Slack threads. The Finance area (`/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance`) was only recently scaffolded (January 2026) and remains empty. That means the highest‑value financial evidence in the system is not in the “finance” domain at all; it is embedded in communications and operational notes. This is not just an organizational preference — it is a structural risk for cash‑flow management, compliance, and scaling.

On the revenue side, there is strong evidence of structured pricing and recurring invoice workflows. The January 13, 2025 invoice follow‑up email shows a standardized billing pattern of $4,000 per keynote invoice, with explicit due dates and payment channels (“Paid via ACH”) in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-13_110833_022627_Re Keynote Invoices Charles Schwab & Asana.md`. This is not ad‑hoc; it is a repeatable billing model with consistent amounts and specific invoice IDs. The pricing transcript from January 2, 2026 goes further: the existence of a $6,200 silver package that is intentionally not sold (“I will never sell this package”) in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-519876848.md` implies a deliberate anchoring and upsell strategy. That is a mature go‑to‑market tactic. The same day’s pricing calculator and margin target (“at least double… at least triple”) in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-521053578.md` shows margin‑conscious pricing, not “creative chaos.” The revenue engine exists; it is just not centralized.

On the cash‑collection side, there is friction and delay. The Entrust invoice thread (May 2025) shows a late payment, requiring repeated follow‑ups, vendor forms, and W‑9 updates in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-05-20_155343_013298_RE [EXTERNAL] Re Entrust RSA Package, Invoice #384.md`. This indicates an operational dependence on vendor onboarding processes that can delay cash. The same holds for the January 2025 invoice follow‑ups: two invoices (Charles Schwab and Asana) remained unresolved while earlier invoices were paid. The business is actively tracking AR but not necessarily closing it quickly. The fact that invoice tracking lives inside a conversational email rather than a centralized AR ledger increases the risk that collections are lost in the noise.

On the cost side, budgets are clearly discussed but dispersed. The October 16, 2024 recap sets a $75K Nagomi contract with payment terms “All due within 30 days; non‑refundable, non‑cancellable” in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-16_213458_027367_Recap for SANS Proposal Build & Nagomi.md`. The October 28, 2024 recap lists a $9K cap for event coverage in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-28_193110_026946_Recap for CyberMarketingCon & Orchid sync.md`. The November 8, 2024 recap shows a $70K international shoot budget that must be reduced to $50K in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-08_163329_026105_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`. These budgets are detailed enough to guide real resource allocation (crew rates, travel costs, deliverables), yet none are stored in the finance domain. This fragmentation makes it difficult to build a project‑level P&L or to analyze margin variance across projects.

Operationally, payment methods are a patchwork: Zelle, ACH, wire, and Justworks. Zelle is used for contractor payments (e.g., $2,537.37 to Claudio Zelaya on November 25, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-25_131910_025121_Zelle® payment of $2,537.37 to Claudio Zelaya has.md`; $500 to CHURCH UNSCRIPTED on January 14, 2025 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-14_181030_022683_Zelle® payment of $500.00 to CHURCH UNSCRIPTED has.md`). ACH deposits from SANS appear in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-22_131621_025364_Re ACH Notification.md`. Wire transfers go to international vendors like SPANISH FIXERS, SLU in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-26_081118_025124_We've sent your wire.md`. Justworks is used for small vendor payments like the $155 payment to Might Cloud LLC in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-22_150355_022254_1 payment has been scheduled on Justworks.md`. This diversity is a sign of flexibility, but it increases the risk of reconciliation errors, missed 1099 tracking, and unclear audit trails. The November 25, 2024 payment‑process meeting recap explicitly acknowledges this operational pain and suggests that Zelle and bank transfers are not reliably working for contractors (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-25_192205_025174_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`).

Compliance and due diligence are the most glaring risk. CRA asked for income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and a 2024 budget on March 19, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-03-19_212900_039897_RE Hacker Valley & CRA Meeting Agenda.md`. That request implies a need for a professional finance package. Yet the January 9, 2025 recap notes that QuickBooks cleanup is required before proceeding with CRA requirements in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`. This indicates the financial system of record is not currently ready to withstand external scrutiny. In a partnership or acquisition scenario, this could delay or derail negotiations.

The cross‑domain pattern is strong: financial reality is embedded in Work (contracts, proposals, meeting recaps), Operations (HubSpot/QuickBooks configuration and invoicing workflow), and Communications (email threads, Slack SOW requests) rather than the Finance domain. This mirrors the “phantom agency” pattern from earlier iterations: real business complexity, minimal internal documentation. The Finance folder’s recent creation suggests recognition of the gap but indicates it has not yet been operationalized.

Opportunities emerge directly from this contrast. The business already has pricing discipline, margin targets, and a recurring billing model; the missing piece is a unified system of record. If Ron formalizes his financial reporting pipeline, he can respond faster to partnership inquiries (like CRA) and increase credibility with enterprise clients. Additionally, the variety of payment rails suggests that a standardized payment stack (ACH + Justworks for contractors + structured invoice schedule) could reduce time spent on payments and reconciliation.

Risks are equally clear. Cash‑flow unpredictability is visible in overdue invoices (Entrust) and open AR (Charles Schwab and Asana). Compliance risk is visible in the absence of financial statements despite external requests. Operational risk is visible in the reliance on email and Slack for contracts and SOWs. There is also a data‑integrity risk: the search index suggests historical finance mentions, but the file system itself has no finance documents, which implies that key artifacts may exist only in external systems or have been archived elsewhere.

Cross‑domain connections to note explicitly:
- Work → Finance: project budgets, contract amounts, payment terms are embedded in Fathom recaps and transcripts rather than financial documentation (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-16_213458_027367_Recap for SANS Proposal Build & Nagomi.md`, `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-08_163329_026105_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`).  
- Communications → Finance: invoice threads and payment confirmations function as the real AR/AP ledger (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-05-20_155343_013298_RE [EXTERNAL] Re Entrust RSA Package, Invoice #384.md`, `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-13_110833_022627_Re Keynote Invoices Charles Schwab & Asana.md`).  
- Operations → Finance: QuickBooks/HubSpot integration and Justworks payments show that finance runs through operational tooling rather than through a dedicated finance archive (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`, `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-22_150355_022254_1 payment has been scheduled on Justworks.md`).  
- System → Finance: the search database indexes a lot of finance‑adjacent items, but the actual finance folder is empty, suggesting potential drift between indexing and actual storage. This is a Triad improvement opportunity (see below).  

Triad improvement note: the search index returns many irrelevant tool and marketing emails while the actual finance folders are empty. A filter that prioritizes `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` and business‑critical paths, or flags “index hits with missing files,” would significantly reduce noise and highlight true gaps.

**PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS**
- 1) Build a real Finance system of record immediately. Impact: High; Effort: Medium; Urgency: High. Populate `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` with actual artifacts (bank statements, tax filings, QuickBooks exports, invoices, contracts, W‑9s). The evidence shows real financial activity but zero archival; without this, due diligence and compliance remain brittle. Use invoice threads like `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-13_110833_022627_Re Keynote Invoices Charles Schwab & Asana.md` and `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-05-20_155343_013298_RE [EXTERNAL] Re Entrust RSA Package, Invoice #384.md` as the seed set for backfilling.  
- 2) Complete QuickBooks cleanup and produce formal statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) for 2023–2025. Impact: High; Effort: Medium; Urgency: High. CRA explicitly requested these on March 19, 2024 in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-03-19_212900_039897_RE Hacker Valley & CRA Meeting Agenda.md`. The January 9, 2025 recap confirms cleanup is needed before CRA requirements (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`). Delivering these statements unlocks partnership and valuation conversations.  
- 3) Standardize AR/AP tracking with clear status fields and scheduled follow‑ups. Impact: High; Effort: Low; Urgency: High. Overdue invoices and missing payments (Entrust, Charles Schwab, Asana) show AR leak risk. Implement a lightweight AR tracker that records invoice ID, amount, due date, payment method, and status; then sync it weekly with the HubSpot/QuickBooks integration referenced in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-09_162941_023052_Recap for Emily sync.md`.  
- 4) Rationalize payment rails and reduce Zelle/wire dependence. Impact: Medium‑High; Effort: Medium; Urgency: Medium. The Zelle/ACH/wire/Justworks mix is operationally heavy and risky. Shift contractor and vendor payments to Justworks or ACH where possible, using the payment‑process improvements discussed on November 25, 2024 (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-25_192205_025174_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`). Reserve wire transfers for exceptional international vendors only.  
- 5) Create a contract and SOW repository with clear linkage to invoices and project budgets. Impact: High; Effort: Medium; Urgency: Medium. Evidence shows SOWs and contracts are in email/Slack (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.02_slack/json/D93FQQ52P/2023-07-05.json`). Centralizing these in `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/25_Archive` or a dedicated legal folder reduces legal exposure and ties revenue to obligations.  
- 6) Formalize project‑level P&L tracking for large engagements. Impact: Medium‑High; Effort: Medium; Urgency: Medium. Budgets of $9K to $75K+ appear across 2024 recaps (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-16_213458_027367_Recap for SANS Proposal Build & Nagomi.md`, `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-11-08_163329_026105_Recap for Zoom Meeting.md`). Track budget vs actuals per project and capture margin variance; this aligns with Ron’s stated margin targets in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-521053578.md`.  
- 7) Document pricing and margin logic in a durable internal artifact. Impact: Medium; Effort: Low; Urgency: Medium. Pricing strategy and margin targets live in transcripts and should be converted into a short internal pricing memo or rate‑card stored under `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/10_Hacker_Valley_Media` or `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance`. The $6,200 silver package and “never sell” positioning is key institutional knowledge (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings/13.01_transcripts/2026/2026-01-02-519876848.md`).  
- 8) Formalize benefits and retirement plan documentation. Impact: Medium; Effort: Low; Urgency: Low‑Medium. 401(k) and HSA/FSA decisions are currently in vendor emails (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2023/2023-04-13_145320_056855_RE Justworks 401(k) Plan - Hacker Valley Media.md`, `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2023/2023-12-06_163642_046557_Start offering HSAs and FSAs for 2024.md`). These should be saved under `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/23_Insurance` or a dedicated HR/benefits area for annual review.  

**QUESTIONS FOR NEXT ITERATION**
- Where are the actual financial statements and tax filings for 2023–2025? Are they in QuickBooks, cloud storage, or email attachments not yet pulled into `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance/22_Taxes`?  
- Do HubSpot invoice PDFs exist locally or in a shared drive? The invoice references in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-01-13_110833_022627_Re Keynote Invoices Charles Schwab & Asana.md` suggest they exist externally; locating and archiving them would close the AR loop.  
- What is the current AR aging list as of January 18, 2026? The last visible overdue items are from late 2024 and mid‑2025; we need an updated ledger to assess cash‑flow risk.  
- Are Zelle and wire transfers being executed from a dedicated business account, or from personal accounts? The Zelle confirmations show “account ending in 9746,” but the account type is not documented in the Finance folder.  
- Where are signed contracts and SOWs for the $75K Nagomi deal and SANS engagements? The recaps mention finalized terms, but the actual PDFs are not located in `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/10_Hacker_Valley_Media` or `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance`.  
- Is the CRA diligence path still active after April 2025 (`/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2025/2025-04-06_134413_014688_Re CRA Hacker Valley Media Diligence.md`)? If so, which documents were delivered and where are they stored?  
- Do any bank statements or reconciliations exist elsewhere in VRAM (e.g., `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/14_Communications` attachments or `/Volumes/VRAM/80-89_Resources`)? A targeted search for “statement” or “bank statement” in attachment directories may reveal hidden records.  
- Are contractor payments consistently captured for 1099 purposes? The reliance on Zelle and wire suggests potential gaps in automated 1099 tracking unless QuickBooks is fully reconciled.

If you want, I can proceed to extract and stage a starter finance archive by pulling the highest‑value artifacts (invoices, payment confirmations, budgets, contracts) into `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` and produce a first‑pass cash‑flow + AR summary.
