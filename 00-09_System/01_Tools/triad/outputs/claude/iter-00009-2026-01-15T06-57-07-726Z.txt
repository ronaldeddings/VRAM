## Refined Recommendations

### Immediate Organization (VRAM)

1. **Create `10_Hacker_Valley_Media/` structure**:
```
10.01_Active_Clients/
    VIA_Science/
    Picus_Security/
    Material_Security/
    Orchid/
    Cobalt/
    White_Knight_Labs/
    7AI/
10.02_HVS_Podcast/
    Episodes_2025/
    Episodes_2026/
    Guest_Pipeline/
10.03_Production_Resources/
    QC_Checklists/
    Brand_Assets/
    SOPs/
10.04_Team/
    Onboarding/
    Roles_Responsibilities/
10.05_Business_Development/
    Proposals/
    Competitive_Intel/
    Pricing/
```

2. **Migrate from Communications**: Move HVM-related Slack channels to reference folder within HVM directory

### Operational Improvements

3. **Formalize pricing model** based on:
   - Cybersecurity Ventures benchmark: $3K/episode
   - Current service tiers (podcast, livestream, company story)

4. **Document production capacity** to prevent rush-order quality issues

5. **Create client dashboard template** (mentioned in deliverables channel but needs standardization)

### Strategic

6. **Track the GTA video success** - viral LinkedIn content is valuable case study
7. **Build repeatable workflows** for each content type (podcast, livestream, promo video)
8. **Consider equipment upgrades** for video team (Christian's AE rendering issues)
