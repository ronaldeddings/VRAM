## Summary

Ron's career reflects a successful pivot from **cybersecurity practitioner** to **media entrepreneur and industry catalyst**. The key insight is that the Dec 2023 salary replacement gap has likely narrowed significantly given the 2024-2025 meeting volume growth (600 → 3,073 → 2,573 meetings/year), but the core challenge remains balancing CEO responsibilities with the "Ron as product" business model. 

The most significant opportunity lies in **systematizing Ron's unique capabilities** so the business can scale beyond his personal capacity while maintaining the authentic industry relationships that drive value.
