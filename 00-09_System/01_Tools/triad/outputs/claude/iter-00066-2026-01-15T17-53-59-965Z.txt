## Summary

**Hacker Valley Media operates a robust B2B content agency** with 15+ recurring clients, 113 pipeline prospects, and a team of ~10 core members. The business model centers on video production, podcast sponsorships, and event coverage — with RSA Conference as the anchor revenue event.

**Key insight**: The 7AI/47AI client represents a 10x growth trajectory and should be priority for contract expansion. Conversely, Interpres shows concerning decline despite being a top account — requires immediate attention.

**Revenue intelligence**: Transcripts contain embedded pricing data ($12-18K per city, $7K+ podcast sponsorships, $360K monthly operational target) that could feed financial planning and forecasting.
