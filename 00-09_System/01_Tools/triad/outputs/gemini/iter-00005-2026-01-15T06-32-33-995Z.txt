I will begin by listing the contents of `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work` to confirm the subdirectory structure and locate the specific folders mentioned in the "Related Content" (like `14_Communications` and `13_Meetings`), as the initial summary indicated "0 subdirectories" which seems contradictory to the file paths provided.
Then, I will perform a search for "goals", "learning", and "development" within the `10-19_Work` directory to identify personal career planning documents for 2025/2026, distinct from general business communications.
I will also read the file `10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2024/2024-10-17_003024_027293_Cultivating Tomorrow's Cyber Guardians Practical S.md` and `10-19_Work/14_Communications/14.01_emails/2023/2023-08-28_233010_051355_The rise of cybersecurity certifications and why w.md` to analyze his specific philosophy on skill acquisition versus certification.
Finally, I will answer the user's request by providing a structured analysis of Ron's Career & Skills focus, highlighting the intersection of his media influence and his advocacy for practical skill development.
