I will start by searching for recent "Sales team sync" summaries or pipeline reviews from late 2024 through 2026 to identify the most current patterns and challenges, and specifically investigate the continuity of the sales leadership.

I will use the optimized search tool to find "Sales team sync" or "Pipeline Review" within the communications directory, specifically targeting the years 2024, 2025, and 2026 to avoid the argument list error.

I will search for "James Sinclair" within the 2025 files to determine his engagement level and leadership status during that period, and I will also search for the specific clients "Praetorian" and "Endor Labs" in the 2025 and 2026 files to track the progress and outcomes of those key deals.
