I will search the `search.db` for terms related to "Hacker Valley" combined with "Strategy", "Roadmap", "2026", and "Budget" to understand the business direction despite the empty operational folder.
I will also search for "Hacker Valley" within `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection` to identify Ron's personal sentiment and unexpressed thoughts regarding the business.
Finally, I will generate an insight report analyzing the contrast between the empty file structure and the high volume of communication, identifying opportunities for operational consolidation.
I will search the `search.db` for "Odin" and "7AI" to understand the potential new product lines or ventures associated with Hacker Valley Media.
I will also search for "Mark" within `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection` and `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/13_Meetings` to identify the person causing friction and understand the dynamic mentioned in Ron's reflections.
Finally, I will create the "Triad Analysis Session" report, synthesizing the "Empty Folder" paradox with the "Odin/7AI" growth vectors and the "Mark" relationship dynamics.
I will search for "7AI" using `search_file_content` to clarify its relationship with Hacker Valley Media and the Odin program.
Then, I will generate the final "Triad Analysis Session" report, synthesizing the findings about HVM's pivot to AI security, the operational friction with Marco, and the strategic implications of the empty file structure.
