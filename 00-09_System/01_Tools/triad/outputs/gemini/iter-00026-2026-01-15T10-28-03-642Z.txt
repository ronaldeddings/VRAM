I will verify the structure of the `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` directory to confirm if the folders exist but are empty, or if the directory is completely void.
I will search the `10-19_Work` directory for filenames containing "invoice", "contract", "statement", or "budget" to see if financial documents are co-located with work projects.
I will read the daily reflection file `/Volumes/VRAM/30-39_Personal/30_Reflection/30.01_daily/2025-10-07.md` to understand the specific context of the "financial security" gratitude mentioned by other agents.
I will verify if the subdirectories within `/Volumes/VRAM/20-29_Finance` are truly empty by listing the contents of `20_Banking` and `21_Investments`.
I will search for files related to "budget" or "spreadsheet" to locate the "household budget" mentioned in the search index, distinguishing between personal and business financial planning.
