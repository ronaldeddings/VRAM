I have all 8 items added to my internal todo list and will execute each one thoroughly.

I will begin by mapping the actual location of the data, as the target directory appears empty, and then proceed to deeply analyze the communications and meeting notes identified in the initial scan.

I have analyzed the initial directory listing and search results. The "Empty Bucket" paradox is confirmed: `/Volumes/VRAM/10-19_Work/10_Hacker_Valley_Media` is empty, but the business is thriving in the "Communications" and "Meetings" directories.

I will now locate and read the specific source files mentioned in the context to gather direct evidence for the analysis, focusing on client packages, pricing, and the strategic shift to "narrative control."
