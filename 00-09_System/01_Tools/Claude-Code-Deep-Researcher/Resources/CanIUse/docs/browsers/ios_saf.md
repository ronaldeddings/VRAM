---

## Important Notes

### Forced Zoom Constraints (up to iOS 14)
Older versions of Safari on iOS had automatic zoom behavior when form inputs received focus, which could degrade user experience. This behavior was improved in iOS 15+.

**Workaround for older versions:**
```css
input {
  font-size: 16px; /* Prevents automatic zoom on focus */
}
```

### Viewport Configuration
Proper viewport meta tag configuration is essential for mobile optimization:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### iOS App Context
When Safari is embedded within native iOS apps (WKWebView), it may have different security policies and capabilities compared to standalone Safari.

### Regular Update Cycle
Safari on iOS receives updates with each iOS release. Users typically update within a few months of new OS releases, but some lag exists. Current versions show high adoption of iOS 18.5+ and iOS 26+.

### Developer Tools
- **Safari Developer Tools** available in macOS Xcode
- Remote debugging via USB connection to Mac
- Full inspection of DOM, CSS, JavaScript, and network activity
- Support for Web Inspector protocol

## Browser Compatibility Considerations

### High Priority
iOS Safari commands a significant share of mobile web traffic (especially in developed countries), making it critical for web compatibility testing. As of the latest data, iOS 18.5+ represents nearly 6% of global traffic.

### Recommended Support
For most production websites:
- Support back to iOS 12.0+ (covers ~99.5% of active devices)
- Optimize for iOS 15.0+ (modern features, better performance)
- Test thoroughly on actual devices when possible

### Fallback Strategies
- Use feature detection (Modernizr, etc.) rather than user-agent detection
- Provide graceful degradation for older versions
- Test CSS Grid, Flexbox, and modern JavaScript in production

### A/B Testing
Monitor your analytics to understand your audience's iOS versions and prioritize accordingly.
