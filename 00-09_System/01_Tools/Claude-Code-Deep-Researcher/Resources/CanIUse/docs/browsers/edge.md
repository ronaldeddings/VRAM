## Usage Statistics Summary

### Current Market Share
- **Version 142** (latest stable): **3.72%** global usage
- **Version 141** (previous): **0.50%** global usage
- **Total combined modern versions**: **~4.23%** global usage

### Trend Analysis

#### Highest Usage Versions
1. **Version 142**: 3.72% - Most recent stable release
2. **Version 141**: 0.50% - Previous stable release
3. **Version 140**: 0.07% - Earlier stable release
4. **Version 138**: 0.028% - Legacy version
5. **Version 139**: 0.028% - Legacy version

#### Historical Versions
- **Versions 12-18** (Original Edge): No measurable global usage
- **Versions 79-91** (Early Chromium): Minimal to no usage
- **Versions 92-139** (Chromium transition): Generally low usage

---

## Browser Characteristics

### Engine Information
- **Original Edge (12-18):** EdgeHTML engine with proprietary rendering
- **Modern Edge (79+):** Chromium engine (same as Google Chrome)

### Compatibility Notes
- **EdgeHTML Era (12-18):** Uses `-ms-` vendor prefix for CSS properties and JavaScript APIs
- **Chromium Era (79+):** Uses `-webkit-` vendor prefix for compatibility with Chrome/Safari/Opera

### Key Features
- Supports modern web standards
- Chromium-based since version 79 (January 2020)
- Cross-platform availability (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Integration with Windows ecosystem
- Rapid release cycle matching Chromium schedule
- Regular security updates and feature releases

---

## Release Timeline

### Original Edge Phase
- **Version 12**: July 2015 - Initial release with Windows 10
- **Versions 13-18**: August 2015 - March 2017 (incremental updates)

### Chromium Migration
- **Version 79**: January 2020 - First Chromium-based release
- **Version 80-91**: January 2020 - March 2021 (transition period)
- **Versions 92+**: July 2021 onwards (stable Chromium alignment)

---

## Development Considerations

### CSS Vendor Prefixes
```css
/* For versions 12-18 */
-ms-transform: rotate(45deg);

/* For versions 79+ */
-webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);
-moz-transform: rotate(45deg);

/* Standard unprefixed */
transform: rotate(45deg);
```

### JavaScript Vendor Prefix
```javascript
// Original Edge
window.msRequestAnimationFrame();

// Modern Edge
window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame();

// Standard
window.requestAnimationFrame();
```

### Recommended Support Strategy
- **For modern projects:** Support Edge 79+ as part of standard Chromium coverage
- **For legacy projects:** Minimal support needed for Edge 12-18; focus on polyfills
- **Current focus:** Versions 140+ recommended for production support

---

## Feature Support

### Modern Standards Support
Modern Edge (79+) provides excellent support for:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- Web Components
- Service Workers
- Fetch API
- Promises and async/await
- WebGL and Canvas
- Media queries and responsive design
- SVG support
- Audio/Video formats (AAC, MP3, H.264)

### Hardware Acceleration
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Video playback optimization
- WebGL 2.0 support

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Priority Versions for Testing
1. **Version 142** - Current stable (3.72% usage)
2. **Version 141** - Previous stable (0.50% usage)
3. **Versions 79-88** - If legacy Edge support required

### Testing Methods
- Use WebDriver for automated cross-browser testing
- Edge DevTools for debugging
- Virtual machines or cloud testing services for version coverage
- Edge's "IE mode" for compatibility with older sites

### Known Issues to Monitor
- Prefix handling differences between versions 12-18 and 79+
- Performance variations across versions
- Platform-specific rendering differences

---

## Notes and Considerations

### Vendor Support
- **Original Edge (12-18):** End of life as of March 9, 2021
- **Chromium Edge (79+):** Actively maintained with regular updates
- **Release Cycle:** New major version every 4 weeks (synchronized with Chromium)

### Ecosystem Considerations
- Tight integration with Windows 10/11
- Microsoft account synchronization features
- Collections feature for web research
- Vertical tabs for organization
- Native PDF support
- Password management integration

### Performance
- Comparable performance to Chrome due to shared Chromium engine
- Efficient battery usage compared to early Edge versions
- Fast startup times and page load performance

### Security Features
- SmartScreen phishing protection
- Tracking prevention (Strict, Balanced, Basic modes)
- Automatic HTTPS upgrade
- Regular security updates from Microsoft
- Windows Defender integration
