# Finding tests

> Learn how Bun's test runner discovers and filters test files in your project

bun test's file discovery mechanism determines which files to run as tests. Understanding how it works helps you structure your test files effectively.

## Default Discovery Logic

By default, `bun test` recursively searches the project directory for files that match specific patterns:

* `*.test.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` - Files ending with `.test.js`, `.test.jsx`, `.test.ts`, or `.test.tsx`
* `*_test.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` - Files ending with `_test.js`, `_test.jsx`, `_test.ts`, or `_test.tsx`
* `*.spec.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` - Files ending with `.spec.js`, `.spec.jsx`, `.spec.ts`, or `.spec.tsx`
* `*_spec.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}` - Files ending with `_spec.js`, `_spec.jsx`, `_spec.ts`, or `_spec.tsx`

## Exclusions

By default, Bun test ignores:

* `node_modules` directories
* Hidden directories (those starting with a period `.`)
* Files that don't have JavaScript-like extensions (based on available loaders)

## Customizing Test Discovery

### Position Arguments as Filters

You can filter which test files run by passing additional positional arguments to `bun test`:

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test <filter> <filter> ...
```

Any test file with a path that contains one of the filters will run. These filters are simple substring matches, not glob patterns.

For example, to run all tests in a `utils` directory:

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test utils
```

This would match files like `src/utils/string.test.ts` and `lib/utils/array_test.js`.

### Specifying Exact File Paths

To run a specific file in the test runner, make sure the path starts with `./` or `/` to distinguish it from a filter name:

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test ./test/specific-file.test.ts
```

### Filter by Test Name

To filter tests by name rather than file path, use the `-t`/`--test-name-pattern` flag with a regex pattern:

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
# run all tests with "addition" in the name
bun test --test-name-pattern addition
```

The pattern is matched against a concatenated string of the test name prepended with the labels of all its parent describe blocks, separated by spaces. For example, a test defined as:

```ts title="math.test.ts" icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN&q=85&s=c6cceedec8f82d2cc803d7c6ec82b240" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
describe("Math", () => {
  describe("operations", () => {
    test("should add correctly", () => {
      // ...
    });
  });
});
```

Would be matched against the string "Math operations should add correctly".

### Changing the Root Directory

By default, Bun looks for test files starting from the current working directory. You can change this with the `root` option in your `bunfig.toml`:

```toml title="bunfig.toml" icon="settings" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
[test]
root = "src"  # Only scan for tests in the src directory
```

## Execution Order

Tests are run in the following order:

1. Test files are executed sequentially (not in parallel)
2. Within each file, tests run sequentially based on their definition order
