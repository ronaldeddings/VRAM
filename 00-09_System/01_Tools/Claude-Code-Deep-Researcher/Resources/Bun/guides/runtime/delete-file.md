# Delete files

To delete a file, use `Bun.file(path).delete()`.

```ts delete-file.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN&q=85&s=c6cceedec8f82d2cc803d7c6ec82b240" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
// Delete a file
const file = Bun.file("path/to/file.txt");
await file.delete();

// Now the file doesn't exist
const exists = await file.exists();
// => false
```
