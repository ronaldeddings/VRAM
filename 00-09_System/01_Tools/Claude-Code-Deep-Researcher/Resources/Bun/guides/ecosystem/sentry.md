# Add Sentry to a Bun app

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry has a first-class SDK for Bun, `@sentry/bun`, that instruments your Bun application to automatically collect error and performance data.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

***

To start using Sentry with Bun, first install the Sentry Bun SDK.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun add @sentry/bun
```

***

Then, initialize the Sentry SDK with your Sentry DSN in your app's entry file. You can find your DSN in your Sentry project settings.

```ts sentry.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN&q=85&s=c6cceedec8f82d2cc803d7c6ec82b240" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/bun";

// Ensure to call this before importing any other modules!
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__SENTRY_DSN__",

  // Add Performance Monitoring by setting tracesSampleRate
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

***

You can verify that Sentry is working by capturing a test error:

```ts sentry.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=Hq64iapoQXHbYMEN&q=85&s=c6cceedec8f82d2cc803d7c6ec82b240" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    foo();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  }
}, 99);
```

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
