# Convert a Buffer to an ArrayBuffer

The Node.js [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) class provides a way to view and manipulate data in an underlying `ArrayBuffer`, which is available via the `buffer` property.

```ts  theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
const nodeBuf = Buffer.alloc(64);
const arrBuf = nodeBuf.buffer;
```
